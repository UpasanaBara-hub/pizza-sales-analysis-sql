# Pizza Sales Analysis (SQL)

## Problem Statement
Food service businesses generate large volumes of transactional sales data, but extracting meaningful insights from this data is often challenging. Understanding sales performance, customer demand patterns, and product contribution is essential for improving revenue and operational efficiency.  
This project addresses the problem of analyzing pizza sales transaction data to identify key business metrics, sales trends, and product performance using SQL.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze pizza sales data using SQL to evaluate revenue performance, identify top- and low-performing products, understand customer demand patterns, and generate insights that support data-driven business decisions.

---

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of pizza sales transaction records, including:
- Order and transaction details  
- Pizza categories and sizes  
- Quantity sold and pricing information  
- Order dates and times  

The dataset was analyzed to understand sales behavior and operational performance.

## Tools and Technologies
- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL compatible queries)
- Relational Database Concepts
- Aggregations, Joins, Subqueries, and CTEs

---

## SQL Analysis Approach
The analysis was conducted using structured SQL queries focusing on:
- Revenue and order-level KPIs  
- Sales aggregation by pizza category and size  
- Time-based analysis (daily and monthly trends)  
- Identification of best-selling and least-selling pizzas  
- Contribution analysis of products to total revenue  

---

## Key Business Insights
- A small number of pizza categories contribute a significant portion of total revenue  
- Certain pizza sizes consistently outperform others in sales volume  
- Sales exhibit clear peak periods, indicating high-demand time windows  
- Some menu items show consistently low demand, highlighting optimization opportunities

## Business Recommendations
- Focus promotional efforts on high-revenue pizza categories and sizes  
- Optimize inventory and staffing during peak sales periods  
- Review pricing or placement of low-performing menu items  
- Use sales trends to support demand forecasting and operational planning
